### WCA Regulations and Guidelines

The WCA Regulations contain the full set of Regulations that apply to all official competitions sanctioned by the World Cube Association.
The WCA Regulations are also supplemented by the [WCA Guidelines](guidelines:top). The Regulations should be considered a complete document, but the Guidelines contain additional clarifications and explanations.

### Wording
Uses of the words "must", "must not", "should", "should not" and "may" match [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

    - 1e2) Every competitor must be available for judging. If required to judge, a competitor may be excused only for a legitimate reason (e.g. being unfamiliar with a puzzle), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification from the competition (see [Regulation 2k](regulations:regulation:2k)).
- 1f) Each event must have one or more scramblers. Exception: 3x3x3 Fewest Moves.
    - 1f1) A scrambler applies scramble sequences to prepare puzzles for attempts (see [Regulation A2](regulations:regulation:A2)).
    - 1f2) Every competitor must be available for scrambling. If required to scramble, a competitor may be excused only for a legitimate reason (e.g. being unfamiliar with scrambling notation), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification from the competition (see [Regulation 2k](regulations:regulation:2k)).

        - 9b3a) Full round format for these events: "Best of 3".
        - 9b3b) For these events, the WCA also recognizes "Mean of 3" rankings and records based on the times from "Best of 3" rounds.
    - 9b4) 3x3x3 Fewest Moves.
        - 9b4a) Full round formats for this event: Best of X" (where X is 1 or 2) or "Mean of 3".
        - 9b4b) Cutoff formats for this event: "Best of 1" cutoff phase for "Best of 2" or "Best of X" (where X is 1 or 2) cutoff phase for "Mean of 3".
    - 9b5) 3x3x3 Multi-Blind.
        - 9b5a) Full round formats for this event: "Best of X" (where X is 1, 2, or 3).
        - 9b5b) Cutoff formats for this event: "Best of X" (where X is 1 or 2) cutoff phase for "Best of Y" (where Y is 2 or 3, and Y > X).
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes, except for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, are measured and truncated to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.
    - 9f2) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes, as well as all times for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind results, are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.49 becomes x, x.50 becomes x+1).
    - 9f4) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.
    - 9f5) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.
    - 9f6) For "Best of X" rounds, each competitor is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f7) For "Best of X" rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.
    - 9f8) For "Average of 5" rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f9) For "Average of 5" rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor has more than one DNF and/or DNS result in the round, their average result for the round is DNF.
    - 9f10) For "Mean of 3" rounds, competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f11) For "Mean of 3" rounds, if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS result, their average result for the round is DNF.
    - 9f12) For "Best of X" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following are used to compare results:
        - 9f12a) For timed results, "better" is defined as the shorter time.
        - 9f12b) For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, "better" is defined as the shorter solution length.
        - 9f12c) For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, or if only 1 puzzle is solved, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings are assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles are better.
    - 9f13) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is the smaller recorded result.
    - 9f14) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds, if two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best attempt per competitor, where "better" is defined as the smaller recorded result.
    - 9f15) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive an identical ranking for the round.
- 9g) A Cutoff Round is a round with a "Best of X" cutoff phase and a cutoff result (e.g. "Best of 2" with a cutoff result of 2 minutes). If the competitor meets the cutoff result in at least one of their cutoff phase attempts, they are eligible for the remaining attempts.

    - 9p2) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by ranking (best x competitors) or by result (all competitors with a better result than x) in the preceding round.
        - 9p2a) For each round, advancement conditions must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.
    - 9p3) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, they may be replaced by the best-ranked non-qualifying competitor from the preceding round.
- 9s) Each round of each event must have a time limit (see [Regulation A1a](regulations:regulation:A1a)).
- 9t) If any change occurs to the results of a competitor after the competition has ended (e.g. score-taking mistake, retroactive penalty), such that the competitor should not have advanced to the next round (or was not allowed to take part in the round), all results of this competitor for all subsequent rounds must be removed.
    - 9t1) If this makes a round no longer compliant with [Regulation 9p1](regulations:regulation:9p1), results of other competitors must not be removed.
    - 9t2) If this makes a round no longer compliant with [Regulation 9m1](regulations:regulation:9m1), [9m2](regulations:regulation:9m2) or [9m3](regulations:regulation:9m3), any subsequent round must not be removed.
    - 9t3) If any change occurs to the result of a competitor, such that another competitor should not have advanced to the next round, the result of the second competitor must not be removed.


## <article-10><solved-state><solvedstate> Article 10: Solved State

- 10b) Only the resting state of the puzzle, after the timer has been stopped, is considered.
- 10c) The puzzle may be in any orientation at the end of the solve.
- 10d) All parts of a puzzle must be physically attached to the puzzle and fully placed in their required positions. Exception: see [Regulation 5b5](regulations:regulation:5b5).
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all colored parts are reassembled and all parts are aligned within the limits specified below:
    - 10e1) For every two adjacent parts (e.g. two parallel, adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned by more than the limit described in [Regulation 10f](regulations:regulation:10f), the puzzle is considered to require one additional move to solve (see "Outer Block Turn Metric" in [Article 12](regulations:article:12)).
    - 10e2) If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state, the puzzle is considered solved without penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is required, the puzzle is be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - 10e4) If more than one move is required, the puzzle is considered unsolved (DNF).
- 10f) Limits of acceptable misalignment for puzzles:
    - 10f1) NxNxN Cubes: at most 45 degrees.

## <article-11><incidents><incidents> Article 11: Incidents

- 11a) Incidents include:
    - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.
    - 11a2) Interference or facility interruptions (e.g. power failure, emergency alarm activation).
    - 11a3) Equipment malfunction.
- 11b) If an incident occurs, the WCA Delegate determines an impartial and appropriate course of action.
- 11d) If the WCA Regulations are not fully clear or if the incident is not covered by the WCA Regulations, then the WCA Delegate must make a decision based on fair sportsmanship (also see [Regulation 11e3](regulations:regulation:11e3)).
- 11e) If an incident occurs during an attempt, the WCA Delegate may grant a competitor an extra attempt, replacing the attempt during which the incident occurred. The competitor must appeal verbally or in writing to the judge and WCA Delegate at the time of the incident, before finishing the original attempt, to be eligible for an extra attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
    - 11e1) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt must be scrambled using a different scramble sequence. This scramble sequence must be generated using a current official version of an official WCA scramble program (see [Regulation 4f](regulations:regulation:4f)).
    - 11e2) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt should be done right after the attempt that caused it, and must replace the original regularly numbered attempt.
    - 11e3) If it is unclear whether an incident should result in an extra attempt, the competitor may be granted a provisional extra attempt that will be used only if it is later found that an extra attempt was appropriate (e.g. by a decision of the WRC).
- 11f) Decisions about an incident may be supported with video or photographic analysis, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 11g) The WCA Delegate must ensure that copies of the Regulations and Guidelines are available (e.g. printed, digital, or accessible via internet) to officials and competitors for consultation on any incidents.
- 11h) A WCA Delegate may require competitors in serious violation of [Regulation 2k3](regulations:regulation:2k3) to leave the competition venue, taking into account the seriousness of the situation and the best possible course of action. If the competitor refuses to do so, they may face disciplinary action in the WCA.

## <article-A><speedsolving><speedsolving> Article A: Speed Solving

- A1) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedures (partially superseded by [Regulation Y7](regulations:regulation:Y7)).
    - A1a) The organization team must apply exactly one kind of time limit (time limit per attempt or cumulative time limit) to each round.
        - A1a1) The default time limit is 10 minutes for each attempt in a round, though the organization team may announce a higher or lower time limit per attempt. In this case, the limit must be the same for all attempts in a round.
        - A1a2) For events other than 3x3x3 Fewest Moves and 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, the organization team may define a cumulative time limit. The cumulative time limit must either apply to all attempts in one round (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes), or to all attempts in a combination of rounds for different events. In this case, the time limit for a particular attempt is the cumulative time limit minus the total time in other attempts counting towards the time limit so far (see [Regulation A1a5](regulations:regulation:A1a5)). If a round has an applicable cumulative time limit, it must have at most one.
        - A1a3) The time limits for all rounds must be announced before the competition, and should not be changed after any affected rounds have begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.
        - A1a4) The competitor must end each solve before the time limit for the attempt is reached. If a competitor's timer reaches the time limit for an attempt, the judge stops the solve immediately and records the result as DNF. Exception: 3x3x3 Multi-Blind (see [Regulation H1b1](regulations:regulation:H1b1)).
        - A1a5) The time counting towards the time limit for an attempt is either the result after time penalties are applied (if the result was not DNF) or the time elapsed in the solve (if the result was DNF).
    - A1b) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
        - A1b1) A Stackmat must be used in addition to the stopwatch. Exception: for events without inspection where the competitor is expected to exceed 10 minutes, use of the Stackmat is optional.
        - A1b2) If a time from the Stackmat timer is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise (e.g. the Stackmat timer malfunctioned, ran for over 10 minutes or was not used at all), the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.
    - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (see [Regulation 2k6](regulations:regulation:2k6)).
- A2) Scrambling:
    - A2a) When called for a round, the competitor submits the puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler. The competitor then waits in their assigned Competitor Waiting Area until they are called to compete.
    - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in [Article 4](regulations:article:4).
        - A2b1) For Square-1, the organization team may enforce placing a thin object in the puzzle to prevent accidental moves from being applied before the start of the attempt. If these objects are used, the organization team should make an announcement before the round starts.
    - A2c) After the scrambler starts scrambling the puzzle, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
        - A2c1) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the start of the attempt.
    - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge raises any concerns with the scrambler, who then conducts a detailed check.
        - A2d1) The scrambler or an authorized judge must check the scrambled puzzle, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to affirm that they applied the correctly-numbered scramble sequence and checked that it matches the image (see [Regulation 4g](regulations:regulation:4g)). Exception: for 6x6x6 Cube, 7x7x7 Cube, and Megaminx the scrambler may sign (or initial) to affirm that the puzzle is sufficiently scrambled (see [Regulation 4g1](regulations:regulation:4g1)).
    - A2e) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation while ensuring that it remains completely covered.
        - A2e1) The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation, and the judge must not influence the orientation they place the puzzle on the mat based on what they know or expect the puzzle state to be.
- A3) Inspection:
    - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the start of each attempt.
        - A3a1) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.
    - A3b) The judge prepares the timer by turning it on and resetting if necessary. Separately, the judge also prepares a stopwatch for timing inspection (partially superseded by [Regulation Y7d1](regulations:regulation:Y7d1)).
        - A3b1) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, the judge asks "READY?". The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute from the moment they are asked, or else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.
        - A3b2) The competitor starts the attempt by confirming that they are ready, and the judge uncovers the puzzle and starts timing the inspection.
    - A3c) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
        - A3c1) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - A3c2) If the parts of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as misalignments stay within the limits of [Regulation 10f](regulations:regulation:10f).
        - A3c3) The competitor may reset the timer before the start of the solve.
        - A3c4) For Square-1, if the use of a thin object inside the puzzle has been enforced by the organization team (see [Regulation A2b1](regulations:regulation:A2b1)), the competitor may remove the object from the puzzle during inspection.
    - A3d) At the end of the inspection, the competitor places the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation. Penalty for placing it outside the mat: time penalty (+2 seconds).
        - A3d2) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "8 SECONDS".
        - A3d3) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "12 SECONDS".
- A4) Starting the solve:
    - A4b) The competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to the competitor. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
        - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle while starting the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A4d) If a Stackmat timer is in use, the competitor should keep their hands on the timer until they see a green timer light. They start the solve by removing their hands from the timer (thus starting the timer).
        - A4d1) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
        - A4d2) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - A4d3) If a stopwatch is in use, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.
    - A4e) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.
- A5) During the solve:
    - A5a) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge or the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface (also see [Regulation 2i](regulations:regulation:2i)). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - A5c) The competitor may hold the puzzle against the surface to help operate the puzzle (see [Regulation 7f1d](regulations:regulation:7f1d)).
- A6) Stopping the solve:
    - A6a) The competitor releases the puzzle before stopping the solve, and stops the solve by stopping the timer. If a stopwatch is in use, the judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
        - A6a1) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that they have stopped the solve. The judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
        - A6a2) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) from their hands and placing their hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the start of the attempt.
    - A6b) The competitor is responsible for stopping the Stackmat timer correctly.
        - A6b1) If the timer stops before the competitor has solved the puzzle and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt is replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits the right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.
        - A6b2) If the timer stops before the competitor has solved the puzzle and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt is disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, they may receive an extra attempt, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
    - A6c) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied after stopping the timer and before releasing the puzzle, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.
    - A6d) The competitor must stop the timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A6e) After releasing the puzzle, the competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.
    - A6f) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has recorded the result on the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
        - A6f1) If the competitor resets the timer before the result has been completely recorded, the judge must not write down the result from memory or from video or photographic evidence, and must disqualify the attempt instead (DNF).
    - A6g) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. They must not touch the puzzle before they have determined whether to assign a penalty for misalignment. Exception: For Clock, the judge will usually need to pick up the puzzle to verify both faces.
    - A6h) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved.
    - A6i) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.
- A7) Recording results:
    - A7a) The judge tells the competitor the result.
        - A7a1) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, they call "OKAY".
        - A7a2) If the judge assigns any penalties, they call "PENALTY".
        - A7a3) If the result is DNF, the judge calls "DNF".
    - A7b) The judge records the result on a score sheet and signs next to the result to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable.
        - A7b1) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded time displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format should be "X + T + Y = F", where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer (the "original recorded time"), Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65). If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).
    - A7c) The competitor must check the recorded result, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable. This finishes the attempt (partially superseded by [Regulation Y7e1](regulations:regulation:Y7e1)).
        - A7c1) If the competitor or the judge refuses to accept and sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute.
        - A7c2) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt before they have begun it, they forfeit the attempt and the result will be considered DNS.
        - A7c3) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt after starting the attempt but before the judge has finished recording the result, the attempt will be considered unfinished (DNF).
        - A7c4) The competitor should not sign an attempt before the judge has recorded and signed the attempt. The competitor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that they and the judge have signed an attempt. If an attempt is found to be missing one or both signatures after the judge delivered the score sheet to the score taker (see [Regulation A7f](regulations:regulation:A7f)), it will be considered unfinished (DNF).
    - A7f) When a competitor's score sheet for a round is complete, the judge delivers the score sheet to the score taker.
    - A7g) At the discretion of the WCA Delegate, an incident or penalty caused by a new competitor's inexperience may be replaced with an extra attempt.


## <article-B><blindfolded><blindfoldedsolving> Article B: Blindfolded Solving

- B1) Standard speed solving procedures are followed, as described in [Article A](regulations:article:A) (Speed Solving). Additional regulations that supersede the corresponding procedures in [Article A](regulations:article:A) are described below (partially superseded by [Regulation Y7](regulations:regulation:Y7)).
    - B1a) There is no inspection period.
    - B1b) The competitor supplies their own blindfold.
- B2) Starting the attempt:
    - B2a) The judge resets the timer(s) as in [Regulation A3b](regulations:regulation:A3b) and indicates that they are ready for the competitor to start the attempt (e.g. placing the puzzle cover in front of the competitor, saying "READY", giving a thumbs-up signal). The competitor must start the attempt within one minute, else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge (partially superseded by [Regulation Y7d1](regulations:regulation:Y7d1)).
    - B2b) The competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to them. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - B2c) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle or the puzzle cover while starting the attempt. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - B2d) The competitor starts the attempt by removing their hands from the timer, thus starting the timer. (This also starts the solve.)
        - B2d1) The competitor removes the cover from the puzzle after starting the timer.
    - B2e) If a stopwatch is in use in addition to a Stackmat timer, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.
    - B2f) If a stopwatch is in use as the only timer, the competitor places their hands on the table (instead of a Stackmat timer). After confirming that they are ready, the competitor starts the solve by lifting the cover. The judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.
- B3) Memorization phase:
    - B3a) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during the memorization phase.
    - B3b) The competitor must not make physical notes. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - B3c) The competitor must not apply moves to the puzzle during the memorization phase. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - B3d) If the parts of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as misalignments stay within the limits of [Regulation 10f](regulations:regulation:10f) (see [Regulation A3c2](regulations:regulation:A3c2)).
- B4) Blindfolded phase:
    - B4a) The competitor dons the blindfold to start the blindfolded phase.
        - B4a1) Until the competitor applies the first move to the puzzle, they may remove the blindfold to return to the memorization phase.
    - B4b) The competitor must not apply moves to the puzzle before they have fully donned the blindfold. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - B4c) As soon as the competitor applies the first move to the puzzle, the judge must ensure that there is a sight blocker (e.g. a sheet of paper or cardboard) between the competitor's face and the puzzle.
        - B4c1) In all cases, the competitor must wear the blindfold such that their view of the puzzle would still clearly be blocked if the sight blocker were not in the way.
        - B4c3) If the judge and competitor agree beforehand, the competitor may choose to place the puzzle behind a suitable object (e.g. a music stand, the surface of the table) by themselves during the blindfolded phase.
    - B4d) The competitor must not look at the puzzle at any point during the blindfolded phase. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
- B5) Stopping the solve:
    - B5a) When using the Stackmat timer, the competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.
    - B5b) When using a stopwatch, the competitor stops the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the surface and notifying the judge that they are stopping the solve. At that moment, the judge stops the timer.
    - B5c) If the competitor is not touching the puzzle, they may remove the blindfold before they stop the timer. They must not touch the puzzle until the end of the solve. Penalty for touching the puzzle: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).

## <article-E><fewest-moves><fewestmovessolving> Article E: Fewest Moves Solving

- E2) Procedure for 3x3x3 Fewest Moves:
    - E2a) The judge distributes a scramble sequence and paper to all competitors. The judge then starts the stopwatch and calls "GO".
        - E2a1) Before the attempt has begun, the competitor must not write on any paper intended for the attempt. Exception: the competitor may write information to identify the attempt (see [Regulation E2c1](regulations:regulation:E2c1)). If they write this information on the paper that contains the scramble sequence, they must write only on the side without the scramble sequence before the attempt. Penalty for writing anything other than information to identify the attempt: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - E2b) All competitors have a total time limit of 60 minutes to find and write a solution.
        - E2b1) The judge should call "5 MINUTES REMAINING" at 55 minutes, and must call "STOP" at 60 minutes.
    - E2c) At 60 minutes, each competitor must submit to the judge a single piece of paper with a written solution and information to identify the attempt.
        - E2c1) Information to identify the attempt is: the competitor's name, WCA ID, or competition registrant ID (at least one, optionally multiple), and optionally the competition name, round, or attempt number. Penalty for a submitted solution without name, WCA ID, or competition registrant ID: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - E2c2) The solution must be a single unambiguous move sequence with each individual move written out in sequential order. Penalty for an ambiguous solution: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - E2c3) The competitor should clearly black out/scribble out all moves on the paper that are not part of their intended solution.
        - E2c4) The competitor's solution must only use moves that are exactly defined as notation for the 3x3x3 Cube in [Regulation 12a](regulations:regulation:12a), and must not use any symbols or combinations of symbols that are not specifically defined there. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - E2c5) The competitor's solution is considered correct if starting with a solved puzzle and applying the scramble sequence followed by the solution results in a solved puzzle. Penalty for an incorrect solution: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - E2d) The competitor's result is the number of moves in their solution, calculated using Outer Block Turn Metric (see [Regulation 12a5](regulations:regulation:12a5)).
        - E2d1) The competitor's solution must not exceed 80 moves (including rotations) when calculated using Execution Turn Metric (see [Regulation 12a6](regulations:regulation:12a6)). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - E2e) The competitor's solution must not be directly derived from any part of the scramble sequence. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
        - E2e1) The WCA Delegate may ask the competitor to explain the purpose of each move in their solution, irrespective of the scramble sequence. If the competitor cannot give a valid explanation, the attempt is disqualified (DNF).
- E3) The competitor may use the following objects during the attempt. Penalty for using unauthorized objects: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - E3a) Paper (supplied by the judge) and pens/pencils or similar (supplied by the judge, or optionally self-supplied).
    - E3b) 3x3x3 Cubes (at most 3, self-supplied), as described in [Article 3](regulations:article:3).
    - E3c) Stickers (self-supplied).
    - E3d) Stopwatch or watch (self-supplied) for keeping track of the elapsed time, if it is approved by the WCA Delegate.
    - E3e) Other non-electronic aids that do not give an unfair advantage, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate (see [Regulation 2i1](regulations:regulation:2i1)).
- E4) The WCA Delegate may choose to publish the solutions (e.g. photo of the score sheets or transcriptions of solutions).

## <article-H><multiple-blindfolded><multipleblindfoldedsolving> Article H: Multi-Blind Solving

- H1) Standard blindfolded solving procedures are followed, as described in [Article B](regulations:article:B) (Blindfolded Solving). Additional regulations that supersede the corresponding procedures in [Article B](regulations:article:B) are described below (partially superseded by [Regulation Y7](regulations:regulation:Y7)).
    - H1a) Before an attempt, the competitor must submit to the organization team the number of puzzles (at least 2) they wish to attempt.
        - H1a1) A competitor is not permitted to change the number of puzzles after submitting their number to the organization team.
        - H1a2) A competitor may request to keep their submission private until all competitors have submitted their numbers. Once all competitors have reported their numbers, the information becomes public (e.g. a competitor may ask for the numbers of any other competitors before starting their attempt).
        - H1a3) Before the attempt, the scrambled puzzles must be placed on the table in an arbitrary orientation while ensuring they remain completely covered. The puzzles should be arranged in a shape as square as possible (e.g. 8 puzzles should be arranged in 2 rows with 3 puzzles and 1 row with 2 puzzles).
    - H1b) If a competitor is attempting fewer than 6 puzzles, they are allotted a time limit of 10 minutes times the number of puzzles in the attempt, else the time limit is 60 minutes.
        - H1b1) The competitor may signal the end of the solve at any time. If and when the time limit is reached, the judge stops the attempt and the attempt is then scored; the time limit for the attempt counts as the original recorded time.
    - H1d) Time penalties for the puzzles of the attempt are cumulative.
    - H1e) If a competitor accidentally applies any moves to one or more puzzles during the memorization phase, those puzzles may be considered unsolved at the end of the attempt (instead of immediately disqualifying the entire attempt), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- H2) The competitor may self supply a flat covering (e.g. a mat or a cloth) for the surface, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. If the competitor wishes to do so, the request must be made at the same time as submitting the number of puzzles (see [Regulation H1a](regulations:regulation:H1a)).
