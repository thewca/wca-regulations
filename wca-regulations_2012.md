- 5b) If a puzzle defect occurs during the solve, the competitor may choose to repair the defect and continue the solve, or choose to stop the solve.
    - 5b1) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, then he must only repair the defective pieces. Tools and pieces of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - 5b2) While repairing a puzzle, the competitor must not intentionally make the position easier to solve than before the defect. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - 5b3) If after repairing the puzzle, but still during the solve, the competitor notices that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and assemble at most 4 pieces to make the puzzle solvable again.
    - 5b4) For blindfolded events a puzzle defect may only be repaired during the solving, and must be done blindfolded. Penalty: disqualification of the solve.
    - 5b5) If, after the solve, parts of the puzzle are still defective (e.g. a centre cap of a cube) or not fully rotated (e.g. a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot), the state of the puzzle is recorded as the worst state that can be obtained by reassembling the puzzle (e.g. a detached pyraminx tip may be assembled in 3 states - one fully solved, and two "+2" states, and thus would be considered a "+2" state).
- 5c) If a competitor has a puzzle defect, this does not give him the right to an extra attempt.

## Article 7: Environment
- 7a) Competitions may be held at any location, inside or outside.
- 7b) Spectators must be at least 1.50 meter away from competitors who are currently competing.

- 9e) New official events may be added each calendar year, and existing official events may be removed.
    - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback by the WCA delegates and the community.
    - 9e4) Other events may be held during a competition, but will be unofficial and therefore not part of the official results of the competition.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes, and corresponding averages/means are measured in hundredths of a second, with averages/means rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second (x.009 becomes x.00, x.010 becomes x.01).
    - 9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes, and corresponding averages/means are measured in seconds, with averages/means rounded to the nearest second (x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
    - 9f4) DNF (Did Not Finish) is the result if the solve was disqualified or unfinished.
    - 9f5) DNS (Did Not Start) is the result if a competitor skipped an attempt in a round.
    - 9f6) In 'Best of x' rounds competitors get x (at most 3) attempts, with the best attempt counting. There may be a combined time limit, example: 30 minutes for 'Best of 2'.
    - 9f7) In 'Best of x' rounds a DNF or DNS is the worst result of a competitor, if all results are DNF and/or DNS the best result of the competitor is DNF.
    - 9f8) In 'Average of 5' rounds competitors get 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, with the mean of the remaining 3 attempts counting.
    - 9f9) In 'Average of 5' rounds one DNF or DNS is counted as the worst result, with more than one DNF and/or DNS the average is DNF.
    - 9f10) In 'Mean of 3' rounds competitors get 3 attempts, with the mean of the 3 attempts counting.
    - 9f11) In 'Mean of 3' rounds if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS the mean is DNF.
    - 9f12) In 'Best of x' rounds the order in the results is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f13) In 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds the order in the results is based on the best average/mean per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f14) If in 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds competitors have the same average/mean result, then the order in the results for these competitors is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f15) Competitors with the same result in a round finish at the same position.
    - 9f16) For the Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded event the order in the results is based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved (higher is better). If the result is lower than 0, the solve is disqualified. If competitors have the same result, then the order is based on total time (lower is better). If competitors have the same result and the same time, then the order is based on the number of puzzles not solved (lower is better).
- 9g) A Combined Round is a round with 2 phases of solves, where only competitors go the second phase if they meet a cut-off time limit during the first phase.
    - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided on position (best x competitors) or on result (all competitors with a best result under x).
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings, if the full WCA regulations were applied.
    - 9i1) Regional records are recognised for best national/continental/world results.
    - 9i2) Results of official WCA competitions are considered to have taken place at the end of the calendar day the competition took place on. If a competition took place on multiple days, the results of each round are considered to have taken place on the last scheduled calendar day of the round.
    - 9i3) If the regulations for an event are changed, then the old regional records stand until they are broken under the new regulations.
- 9j) Events must be held only once during a competition.
- 9k) If an event is held, then all competitors may participate in that event.

    - 9p1) For each round of an event, at least 25% of the competitors must not proceed to the next round.
    - 9p2) Either the best x competitors proceed to the next round, or all competitors who beat a specific result (announced before the round).
    - 9p3) Competitors who qualify for the next round but forfeit their positions in the next round may be replaced by the next best competitors in the round.
- 9r) A qualification round is a round of an event held before the first round of the event.
    - 9r1) When announcing the competition the organisation team must announce:
        - how many competitors will compete in the first round of the event
        - the maximum number of competitors in the qualification round of the event, and how many of the competitors will proceed to the first round
        - which average/mean time or single solve time for the WCA ranking of the event is required to directly qualify for the first round (or other round) of the event
        - the date taken for deciding the average/mean time or single solve time on the WCA ranking of each competitor
    - 9r2) All competitors of an event who are not directly qualified for the first round of the event, must compete in the qualification round of the event.
    - 9r3) There may be changes to increase the maximum number of competitors in qualification round or first round, or to add a qualification round for newly registered competitors. These changes must be made at least two weeks before the competition.
- 9s) A time limit must be set for a round of an event. If a competitor does not solve within the time limit, then his solve may be stopped and disqualified by the judge. The WCA Delegate decides whether the competitor may continue the round.

## Article 10: Solved state
- 10b) Only the resting state of a puzzle is considered, when the timer has stopped.
- 10c) Puzzles may be in any orientation at the end of the solve.
- 10d) All pieces of a puzzle must be fully attached to the puzzle, and in their required positions. Exceptions: see Article 5 Puzzle defects.
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all face colours are reconstructed and all the parts are aligned within certain limits.
    - 10e1) For each two adjacent parts (for example two parallel adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned more than the limit described in Article 10f, these two parts are considered to need one move to be solved (Half Turn Metric).
    - 10e2) If no move is needed to bring the puzzle to solved state, the puzzle is considered solved without a penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is needed, the puzzle is considered solved with a penalty of 2 seconds.
    - 10e4) If more than one move is needed, the solve is ruled DNF.
- 10f) Limits of misalignment for puzzles:
    - cube shaped puzzles: =< 45 degrees
    - Megaminx: =< 36 degrees
    - Pyraminx: =< 60 degrees
    - Square-1: =< 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/)

Examples:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45° Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45° Not solved
2 misalignments > 45°

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45° Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45°

Not solved
2 misalignments > 45° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45° Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45°

- 10g) For Magic (and similar puzzles) the minimum angle that tiles must have compared to the connecting tiles is 135°.
    - 10g1) If one or two pairs of connecting tiles have a smaller angle with each other, and the puzzle is otherwise solved, then the puzzle is considered solved, with a penalty of 2 seconds. In all other cases the result is DNF.
- 10h) Other puzzles are solved according to the solved state as defined in the generally accepted goal of the puzzle, with the regulations of the cube solved state applied when applicable.

## Article 11: Incidents
- 11a) Incidents are:
    - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.

- 11e) In case of an incident the WCA Delegate may award a competitor another attempt, that replaces the attempt for which the incident happened. The competitor must appeal at the time of the incident and before completing the solve to be eligible for another attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
- 11f) The WCA Delegate must not support his decisions with video or photograph analysis.

    - A1a) The time limit per solve is 10 minutes, or lesser/higher if announced before the event. If announced before the event, cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes; the time elapsed in a solve declared a "DNF" counts towards the cumulative time limit). Time limits cannot be changed after an event has begun.
    - A1b) A stopwatch is used for time measurement, in addition to a Stackmat, if the time limit is higher than 10 minutes. If the puzzle solving time is under 10 minutes, the Stackmat time is the result, otherwise the stopwatch time is the result.
    - A1c) Competitors must be able to fulfil an event's requirements if they participate in it. Competitors competing with expectation of DNF may be disqualified from an event at the discretion of the Delegate.

    - A2a) The competitor hands over the solved puzzle to the scrambler and waits in the competitors area until he is called to compete.
    - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.
    - A2c) The competitor must not see the puzzle between the time when the scrambler starts the scramble and the start of the inspection phase.
    - A2d) When taking the puzzle from the scrambler, the judge does a quick general inspection of thorough scrambling of the puzzle. In case of doubt the judge contacts the scrambler for a detailed check.
    - A2e) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in a random orientation and covers it completely with an object. The competitor must not request an orientation. Penalty: 2 seconds.
