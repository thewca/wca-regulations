    - 9f7) For 'Best of X' rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.
    - 9f8) For 'Average of 5' rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts shall be removed, and the mean of the remaining 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f9) For 'Average of 5' rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor receives more than one DNF and/or DNS in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.

    - 9f12c) For Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, the result is disqualified. If competitors achieve the same result, rankings shall be assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings shall be assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors fail to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles is better.
    - 9f13) For 'Mean of 3' and 'Average of X' rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is the shorter recorded time.
    - 9f14) For 'Mean of 3' and 'Average of X' rounds where two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "better" is defined as the shorter recorded time.

## Article A: Speed Solving

- A1) Attempts for events categorised under Speed Solving must abide by the following procedure.
    - A1a) The organisation team may enforce time limits for attempts and/or rounds.
    - A1a1) The default time limit per attempt is 10 minutes, though the organisation team may announce a higher/lower time limit.
    - A1a2) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a "DNF" result counts towards the cumulative time limit.
    - A1a3) For any round, time limits must be announced before the round begins, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who shall carefully consider the fairness of the change.
    - A1b) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
    - A1b1) Simultaneous use of a Stackmat is optional.
    - A1b2) If the Stackmat time is available, it is the result; otherwise the stopwatch time is the result.
    - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements. A competitor competing with expectation of a "DNF" result may be disqualified from the event at the discretion of the Delegate.
- A2) Scrambling
    - A2a) At the beginning of the event, the competitor submits his puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler and waits in the competitors area until he is called to compete.
    - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.
    - A2c) After the scrambler starts the scramble, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase begins.
    - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge shall briefly inspect the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of said puzzle. The judge shall raise any concerns with the scrambler, who shall then conduct a detailed check.
    - A2e) The judge shall place the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation and shall cover it completely. The competitor must not request a specific orientation.
- A3) Inspection
    - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle before beginning each solve.
    - A3a1) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.
    - A3b) Before the competitor begins inspecting, the judge shall reset the timer and, where applicable, the stopwatch.
    - A3b1) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, he asks 'READY?'. The competitor must be ready to begin the attempt within one minute of being called. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt.
    - A3b2) When the competitor confirms his readiness, the judge uncovers the puzzle. If the attempt requires a stopwatch, the judge starts it at the same time.
    - A3c) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
    - A3c1) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt.
    - A3c2) If the pieces of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as stays within the limits within the limits described in 10f.
    - A3c3) The competitor may reset the timer before he starts the attempt.
    - A3d) At the end of the inspection, the competitor must place the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation and position.

    - A4b) The competitor must place his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the timer, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the start of the solve. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A4d) The competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing his hands from the timer, thereby starting the timer.

    - A6a1) If a stopwatch is in use as the timing device, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that he has finished.
    - A6a2) When using a stopwatch without a Stackmat, the competitor's default signal consists of the release of any puzzle(s) in hand and the placing of his hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree upon another appropriate notification before the start of the solve.
    - A6b) The competitor is responsible for stopping the timer correctly.
    - A6b1) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt shall be replaced by an additional attempt. A competitor forfeits his right to said additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.
    - A6b2) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher then the attempt shall be disqualified, unless the competitor can demonstrate to the WCA Delegate's satisfaction that the timer malfunctioned during the attempt.
    - A6c) The timer must be stopped using both hands, which shall be placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A6d) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: 2 seconds.
    - A6e) The competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt. If no moves have been done, a penalty of 2 seconds may be given instead, at the discretion of the judge.

- A7) Recording results
    - A7a) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, he shall call 'OK'.
    - A7b) The judge shall record the result of the approved solve on a score sheet.
    - A7b1) If penalties are applied, the judge shall record the result displayed on the timer, and record the penalty adjacent, in the format "X + T + Y = F", where X represents a sum total of penalties incurred before a solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer, Y represents a sum total of penalties incurred during/after a solve, and F represents the final result. If the value of X and/or Y is zero, the relevant term is omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).
    - A7c) The judge and competitor must both sign the score sheet to acknowledge the result. Should either of them refuse to sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate may sign in their place.
