    - 1c1) Reporting to the WCA Board regarding adherence to WCA regulations during the competition, the competition proceedings, and any incidents or abnormalities therein. Reports must be available within one week of the competition date. [NOTE: To whom are reports required to be made available? Are they closed to the Board, between the Board and the organisation team, or open to the public/WCA community? This ought to be specified.]
    - 1c3) Sending the competition results to the WCA  Results Team. [Who/what is the Results Team? This needs to be defined in the document, or else a referred definition ought to be provided.] Results should be available at the end of the last day of competition.
    - 1c3a) All scrambles used during a competition should be sent concurrent with the results of said competition.

    - 1c8) Providing the scrambles. [NOTE: Is there another article with further clarification? If so, provide the article number.]
    - 1c9) Decisions on changes to the scheduled time of rounds. In cases of such change, a clear announcement should be made to all competitors.
- 1e) Each event must be assigned one or more judges.

    - 1g2) Changes to the score sheets may only be made with the consent of the WCA Delegate.
- 1h) Events may be conducted in flights, as necessary. [NOTE: "flight" may be a debate-centric term; you might prefer another, less specific term, such as "shift"]  [NOTE: Is it necessary to spell out the reasons for splitting an event into flights? Does that affect the competition in a regulatory capacity?]
    - 1h1) Competing judges/scramblers for a round must not judge or scramble for competitors in their own [group NOTE: use terminology consistent with article 1h.], before they have completed all of their solves for the round. 
    - 1h2) Different [groups NOTE: see above] must use different scramble sequences and same [groups] must use the same scramble sequences.
- 1i) The WCA Delegate must be announced to the competitors before the competition starts.

## Article 2: Competitors
- 2a) Any person compete in a WCA competition, if he:
    - 2a1) complies with WCA regulations;
    - 2a2) meets the competition requirements, which must be clearly announced before the competition;
    - 2a3) is not suspended by WCA Board.

    - 2c1) A competitor shall not be eligible to compete without a completed registration. [NOTE: Please decide the exact person(s) who shall determine the composition of a "complete registration," and use one designation for said person(s) throughout. In the space of two sub-articles, you've used "organisation team," "competition organiser" and "WCA Delegate".]
- 2d) All information (except: name, country, date of birth [NOTE: I find it hard to believe that date of birth is not considered confidential. Most organisations (especially online transactions/registries) will not release DOBs for fear of identity theft/fraud liability], gender, selected events and competition results [NOTE: also, given the breadth of such exceptions, what personal information remains protected?]) must be used for the competition only, and may only be disclosed to outside organisations/persons with the consent of the competitor. A competitor's date of birth is considered confidential information, and must never be shared with other parties without prior consent of the competitor or legal guardian, as applicable.
- 2e) Competitors may only represent countries of which they hold citizenship. The WCA Delegate should verify citizenship standing by means of  documents (e.g. a passport). If a competitor is found ineligible to represent the country under which they have registered, the competitor may be retroactively disqualified and/or suspended at the discretion of the WCA Board.
    - 2e1a) The eligible countries are defined by Wikipedia List of sovereign states ("Internationally recognized sovereign states" and "Other states"). [NOTE: Why Wikipedia? You could use the UN list, or something actually recognized by sovereign governments.]
    - 2e2) Competitors with more than one citizenship may change their country of representation in their first competition of a calendar year.
- 2f) Competitors must obey venue regulations and conduct themselves in a manner considerate of others.
- 2g) Competitors must remain quiet when inside the designated competition area. Talking is permitted, but must be kept at a reasonable level, and away from  active competitors.
- 2h) Competitors shall be fully dressed while in the competition venue. At the discretion of the Delegate, competitors may be disqualified for inappropriate clothing.
    - 2h1) Exception: Competitors may be barefoot if 3x3x3 Feet Solving is being held at the competition.
- 2i) While competing, competitors must not use sound  or other electronic equipment (e.g. cell phones, MP3 players, dictaphones, or additional lighting).
- 2j)  The WCA Delegate may disqualify a competitor who fails arrive punctually for a round of any event.
- 2k)  A competitor may be disqualified from a competition by the WCA Delegate if:
    - 2k1) The competitor fails to show up in time for registration for the competition.
    - 2k2) The competitor is suspect of cheating or defrauding the officials during the competition.
    - 2k3) The competitor behaves in a way that is unlawful, violent or indecent; or intentionally damages venue facilities or personal property within the venue.

- 2p) The WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute before the start of the next round of the event.
- 2q) Disputes are only permitted within the parameters of the discretion of the organisation team. [NOTE: This is extremely vague; I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean. Are there actual parameters (and if so, are they listed anywhere in this document?)? If there are parameters, then how much leeway is afforded "the discretion of the organisation team?"] 
- 2r) The competitor must accept the final ruling of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the competitor from the competition.The final ruling of the WCA Delegate may not be disputed; further dispute may lead to disqualification of the competitor in question. [NOTE: Perhaps you should find some way to replace all instances of "Penalty:" with a full sentence, as demonstrated above.]
    - 2s1) For competitors with hearing disabilities, judges may replace the vocal instructions with hand signals.
    - 2s2) For competitors with physical disabilities, judges may give help with starting and stopping the timer.
    - 2s3) Competitors with other disabilities that may prevent them from abiding by one or more Competition Regulations may request special accommodations with the WCA Delegate. Such accommodations must be noted in the Delegate Report. [NOTE: All sub-articles (e.g. 2s) with sub-points (e.g. 2s1) should have a heading at the sub-article level.]
- 2t) All competitors should be familiar with and understand the WCA regulations before the competition.

## Article 3: Puzzles

Competitors with a medically documented visual disability may use textured puzzles with different textures on each face; said textures/patterns must be uniform per face.
    - 3d1) Textured puzzles must have different colours on each face to aid in scrambling and judging.
- 3e) The colours of puzzles must be solid and of uniform shade per face; each colour on the puzzle must be clearly distinct from other colours thereupon.
- 3f) Stickers/tiles/textures/paint must not be thicker than 1.5 mm, or the generally available thickness for non-cube puzzles.
- 3g) Puzzles may be refined internally by sanding or applying any form of lubricant.
- 3h) Modifications that enhance the basic concept of a puzzle are not permitted. Examples of said enhancement include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colours on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, more or other solved states.
- 3i) "Pillowed" and other modified versions of puzzles are permitted if and only if the modification does not make available to the competitor additional information (e.g. identity of faces) [from any possible angle of the puzzle in any possible configuration NOTE: this is confusing and possibly unnecessary.], as compared to a non-pillowed version of the same puzzle. This is subject to the following exceptions and clarifications:
    - 3i1) Exception to 3i: Pillowed 7x7x7 cubes are permitted.
    - 3i2) "Stickerless" cubes, and other cubes whose face colours are visible inside the cube, are not permitted. [NOTE: I find this language vague, but perhaps most cubers will be familiar with the object in question.]
- 3j) Any modifications to a puzzle that result in poor performance by a competitor are not grounds for additional attempts in the event.
- 3k) Puzzles must be clean, and must not have any markings, elevated pieces, damage, or other differences that distinguish one piece from any likepiece. [NOTE: The term "piece" may be vague.]
- 3l) Puzzles must be approved by  the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.

- 3n) All brands of puzzle and puzzle parts are allowed, given the puzzles' complance with all WCA regulations.

## Article 4: Scrambling
- 4a) A scrambler must apply the scramble sequences.
- 4b) Puzzles must be scrambled using computer-generated random scramble sequences or scrambled positions known only to the WCA Delegate and the scrambler. [NOTE: The "must" employed at the beginning of the sentence applies to all clauses in said sentence -- no need to write it in twice.] Generated scrambles must not be inspected before the competition, and must not be filtered or selected in any way by the WCA Delegate.
- 4d) Cube puzzles and Megaminx must be scrambled with the lightest-coloured face (usually white) on top and darkest-coloured adjacent face (usually green) in front. Pyraminx must be scrambled with the lightest-coloured face (usually yellow) on bottom and darkest-coloured face (usually green) in front. Square-1 must be scrambled with the darkest-coloured face in front (of the two possible scrambling orientations).
- 4f) Competition scrambles must be generated using the current official version of the WCA scrambling program (available via the WCA website).

## Article 5: Puzzle Defects
- 5a) Examples of puzzle defects include: popped pieces; broken wires; and detached screws,caps, and stickers.
- 5b) If a puzzle defect occurs during the solve, the competitor may choose to repair the defect and continue the solve, or to discontinue the solve.
    - 5b1) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, he must repair only the defective pieces. Tools and/or pieces of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Noncompliant competitors shall be disqualified for the duration of the solve.
    - 5b2) Any repair to a puzzle must not confer upon the competitor any advantage in solving said puzzle. Noncompliant competitors shall be disqualified for the duration of the solve.
    - 5b3) If, after repairing the puzzle but before the end of the solve, the competitor finds that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and assemble a maximum of four pieces to render the puzzle solvable.
    - 5b4) In blindfolded events, a puzzle defect may only be repaired during the solve, and all repairs must be performed blindfolded. Noncompliant competitors shall be disqualified for the duration of the solve.
    - 5b5) If, after the solve,  parts of the puzzle(e.g. a centre cap of a cube)  are still defective or not fully rotated (e.g. a 5x5x5 centre piece twisted in its spot), the result shall be recorded as the worst state obtainable via reassembly of the puzzle (e.g. a pyraminx with a detached tip may be reassembled in three states one fully solved, and two "+2" states; said solve would be recorded as a "+2" state). [NOTE: Is the term "+2" the most correct technical definition? If so, perhaps the quotation marks should be removed.]  
- 5c) If a competitor's puzzle presents a defect during a solve, he is not permitted an extra attempt.

## Article 7: Environment
- 7a) Competitions may be held atany location, indoors or outdoors.
- 7b) Spectators must remain at least 1.50 meters away from the competition stage when it is in use..
- 7c) Lighting of the competition area ought be paid special attention, [NOTE: Is this an advisory or a regulation?] White light is preferred. [NOTE: If the latter clause is necessary, perhaps "such that competitors may readily differentiate between the colours on the puzzles."]
- 7e) The competition area must be smoke-free.
- 7f) The timer must be attached to the mat and placed upright on the table, desk or other suitable console , with the device on the near side of the mat. [NOTE: Specify -- near to whom/what? The competitor? The judge? e.g. "the side of the mat nearest the competitor".] The mat must be placed flush against the surface of the table.
    - 7f1) Exception: In Solving With Feet the timer must be placed directly on the floor. The timer device may [NOTE: is this an advisory or a regulation?] be placed on the far side of the mat. [NOTE: again, specify -- is this the far side from the competitor's perspective?]
- 7h) A competitors area must be designated within the competition area.
    - 7h1) Competitors who have been called to compete - and only those competitors - must remain within the competitors area until all solves of the round have been completed. [NOTE: does this mean all of their own solves of the round, or all the solves of all competitors in the round?]
    - 7h3) Competitors in the competitors area must not communicate with each other about the scrambled positions of the puzzles of the round in progress. Noncompliant competitors may be disqualified at the discretion of the Delegate.

## Article 8: Competitions

- 9e) New official events may be added each calendar year, and existing official events may be removed.
    - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback by the WCA delegates and the community.
    - 9e4) Other events may be held during a competition, but will be unofficial and therefore not part of the official results of the competition.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes, and corresponding averages/means are measured in hundredths of a second, with averages/means rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second (x.009 becomes x.00, x.010 becomes x.01).
    - 9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes, and corresponding averages/means are measured in seconds, with averages/means rounded to the nearest second (x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
    - 9f4) DNF (Did Not Finish) is the result if the solve was disqualified or unfinished.
    - 9f5) DNS (Did Not Start) is the result if a competitor skipped an attempt in a round.
    - 9f6) In 'Best of x' rounds competitors get x (at most 3) attempts, with the best attempt counting. There may be a combined time limit, example: 30 minutes for 'Best of 2'.
    - 9f7) In 'Best of x' rounds a DNF or DNS is the worst result of a competitor, if all results are DNF and/or DNS the best result of the competitor is DNF.
    - 9f8) In 'Average of 5' rounds competitors get 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, with the mean of the remaining 3 attempts counting.
    - 9f9) In 'Average of 5' rounds one DNF or DNS is counted as the worst result, with more than one DNF and/or DNS the average is DNF.
    - 9f10) In 'Mean of 3' rounds competitors get 3 attempts, with the mean of the 3 attempts counting.
    - 9f11) In 'Mean of 3' rounds if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS the mean is DNF.
    - 9f12) In 'Best of x' rounds the order in the results is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f13) In 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds the order in the results is based on the best average/mean per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f14) If in 'Mean of' and 'Average of' rounds competitors have the same average/mean result, then the order in the results for these competitors is based on the best result per competitor, with lower meaning better.
    - 9f15) Competitors with the same result in a round finish at the same position.
    - 9f16) For the Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded event the order in the results is based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved (higher is better). If the result is lower than 0, the solve is disqualified. If competitors have the same result, then the order is based on total time (lower is better). If competitors have the same result and the same time, then the order is based on the number of puzzles not solved (lower is better).
- 9g) A Combined Round is a round with 2 phases of solves, where only competitors go the second phase if they meet a cut-off time limit during the first phase.
    - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round, must be decided on position (best x competitors) or on result (all competitors with a best result under x).
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings, if the full WCA regulations were applied.
    - 9i1) Regional records are recognised for best national/continental/world results.
    - 9i2) Results of official WCA competitions are considered to have taken place at the end of the calendar day the competition took place on. If a competition took place on multiple days, the results of each round are considered to have taken place on the last scheduled calendar day of the round.
    - 9i3) If the regulations for an event are changed, then the old regional records stand until they are broken under the new regulations.
- 9j) Events must be held only once during a competition.

    - 9p1) For each round of an event, at least 25% of the competitors must not proceed to the next round.
    - 9p2) Either the best x competitors proceed to the next round, or all competitors who beat a specific result (announced before the round).
    - 9p3) Competitors who qualify for the next round but forfeit their positions in the next round may be replaced by the next best competitors in the round.
- 9r) A qualification round is a round of an event held before the first round of the event.
    - 9r1) When announcing the competition the organisation team must announce:
        - how many competitors will compete in the first round of the event
        - the maximum number of competitors in the qualification round of the event, and how many of the competitors will proceed to the first round
        - which average/mean time or single solve time for the WCA ranking of the event is required to directly qualify for the first round (or other round) of the event
        - the date taken for deciding the average/mean time or single solve time on the WCA ranking of each competitor
    - 9r2) All competitors of an event who are not directly qualified for the first round of the event, must compete in the qualification round of the event.
    - 9r3) There may be changes to increase the maximum number of competitors in qualification round or first round, or to add a qualification round for newly registered competitors. These changes must be made at least two weeks before the competition.
- 9s) A time limit must be set for a round of an event. If a competitor does not solve within the time limit, then his solve may be stopped and disqualified by the judge. The WCA Delegate decides whether the competitor may continue the round.

## Article 10: Solved state
- 10b) Only the resting state of a puzzle is considered, when the timer has stopped.
- 10c) Puzzles may be in any orientation at the end of the solve.
- 10d) All pieces of a puzzle must be fully attached to the puzzle, and in their required positions. Exceptions: see Article 5 Puzzle defects.
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all face colours are reconstructed and all the parts are aligned within certain limits.
    - 10e1) For each two adjacent parts (for example two parallel adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned more than the limit described in Article 10f, these two parts are considered to need one move to be solved (Half Turn Metric).
    - 10e2) If no move is needed to bring the puzzle to solved state, the puzzle is considered solved without a penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is needed, the puzzle is considered solved with a penalty of 2 seconds.
    - 10e4) If more than one move is needed, the solve is ruled DNF.
- 10f) Limits of misalignment for puzzles:
    - cube shaped puzzles: =< 45 degrees
    - Megaminx: =< 36 degrees
    - Pyraminx: =< 60 degrees
    - Square-1: =< 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/)

Examples:

Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45° Solved, with penalty
Only 2 adjacent parts misaligned > 45° Not solved
2 misalignments > 45°

Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45° Solved = no penalty
Misalignment <= 45°

Not solved
2 misalignments > 45° Solved = no penalty
All misalignments <= 45° Solved, with penalty
1 misalignment > 45°

- 10g) For Magic (and similar puzzles) the minimum angle that tiles must have compared to the connecting tiles is 135°.
    - 10g1) If one or two pairs of connecting tiles have a smaller angle with each other, and the puzzle is otherwise solved, then the puzzle is considered solved, with a penalty of 2 seconds. In all other cases the result is DNF.
- 10h) Other puzzles are solved according to the solved state as defined in the generally accepted goal of the puzzle, with the regulations of the cube solved state applied when applicable.

## Article 11: Incidents
- 11a) Incidents are:
    - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.
    - 11a2) Interference or distractions or facility distractions (such as power failure, emergency alarm).

- 11b) In case of an incident during an event the WCA Delegate of the event must decide the outcome.
- 11d) If the WCA regulations are not fully clear or if the incident is not covered by the WCA regulations, then the WCA Delegate must make his decision based on fair sportsmanship.
- 11e) In case of an incident the WCA Delegate may award a competitor another attempt, that replaces the attempt for which the incident happened. The competitor must appeal at the time of the incident and before completing the solve to be eligible for another attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
- 11f) The WCA Delegate must not support his decisions with video or photograph analysis.

## Article 12: Notation
