# WCA Guidelines 2012

The WCA Guidelines supplement the WCA Regulations. Guidelines are numbered in correspondence with related regulations.

To make the Regulations and Guidelines easier to read we use "he" where the reader should read "she or he".
The use of the words "must", "must not", "should", "should not" and "may" comply with RFC 2119.

Note the following:
- Mutiple guidelines may correspond to the same Regulation.
- Several guidelines were moved from a previous version of the Regulations, with their numbering preserved (and therefore are not numbered corresponding to an existing Regulation). These are marked with [SEPARATE].
- For informational reasons, each Guideline is classified using one of the following labels. Note that this should be treated as metadata, not a description of importance.
  - [ADDITION] Additional information to supplement the Regulations.
  - [CLARIFICATION] Information to address any possible questions about interpretation of the Regulations.
  - [EXPLANATION] Information that clarifies the intent of Regulations.
  - [RECOMMENDATION] Something that is not strictly mandatory, but that should be done if possible.
  - [REMINDER] Information that may be addressed other Regulations/Guideline, but whose relevance is worth reiterating.

## Article 4: Scrambling

- 4b1) [REMINDER] The WCA Delegate must never re-generate any scrambles to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not be permitted to glance at the scrambles for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate "fairer" scrambles.

- A1a3) [REMINDER] The organisation team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two attempts in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a combined round), and that changing time limits after the beginning of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.
- A1a4) [REMINDER] If a competitor has accidentally been permitted to exceed the time limit, the time limit must be enforced retroactively, and the judge, competitor, and WCA Delegate should be informed (see Regulation 1g2). Judges must always be aware of the time limit for a current attempt (which might depend on previous attempts, in the case of a cumulative time limit).

- A3c3) [CLARIFICATION] Although the judge is required to reset the timer for the competitor (see Regulation A3b), the competitor may reset it before/during the inspection phase if the judge accidentally neglected to do so.

## Article H: Multiple Blindfolded Solving

- H1b1) [REMINDER] The attempt is not disqualified for reaching the time limit, due to exceptions for Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see Regulations A1a4 and A1a5).
- H1b1) [ADDITION] The judge may permit the competitor to continue the attempt unofficially, but the attempt must be stopped and judged first, in full accordance with the Regulations.
- H1d) [EXAMPLE] Example: If a competitor attempts 10 cubes, stops with a time of 59:57, and has two time penalties, the time for the result is 59:57 + 2*2 = 60:01 (also see Guideline A1a5).
- H1d) [EXAMPLE] Example: If a competitor attempts 10 cubes, and the judge stops him at one 60 minutes, and has two time penalties, the time for the result is 60:00 + 2*2 = 60:04 (also see Guideline A1a5).
