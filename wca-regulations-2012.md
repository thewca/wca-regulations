# WCA Regulations 2012

The WCA Regulations are supplemented by the WCA Guidelines.

To make the Regulations and Guidelines easier to read we use "he" where the reader should read "she or he".
The use of the words "must", "must not", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not" and "may" comply with RFC 2119.


## Article 1: Officials

- 1a) A competition must include a WCA Delegate and an organisation team (consisting of one or more individuals) with the following officials: judges, scramblers and score takers.
- 1b) The organisation team of a competition is responsible for logistics before and during the competition.
- 1c) The WCA Delegate may delegate responsibilities to other members of the organisation team, but is ultimately accountable for how these responsibilities are carried out. The WCA Delegate for a competition is responsible for:
  - 1c1) Reporting to the WCA Board regarding adherence to WCA Regulations during the competition, the overall course of the competition, and any incidents. The report must be submitted to the WCA Board within one week of the competition date.
  - 1c3) Sending the competition results to the WCA Results Team.
    - 1c3a) All scramble sequences used during a competition must be sent with the results of the competition.
    - 1c3b) Scramble sequences must be labelled with the events, rounds, and heats for which they were used.
  - 1c4) Sending corrections to the competition results to the WCA Board.
  - 1c5) Advising the other officials where necessary.
  - 1c6) Approving all events and round formats of a competition, before the competition starts, and if changes are required during the competition.
  - 1c7) Decisions about disqualifying competitors during the competition.
  - 1c8) Providing the scramble sequences.
  - 1c9) Decisions about changes to the scheduled times of rounds. In cases of such changes, a clear announcement must be made to all competitors.
  - 1c10) Making a copy of the WCA Regulations available at the competition.
- 1e) Each event must have one or more judges.
  - 1e1) A judge is responsible for executing the procedures of the event.
    - 1e1a) A judge may judge multiple competitors simultaneously at the discretion of the Delegate, as long as the judge is able ensure that all WCA Regulations are followed at all times.
  - 1e2) Each competitor shall be available for judging, if needed by organisation team. Penalty: disqualification from the competition.
- 1f) Each event must have one or more scramblers. Exception: puzzles that are not scrambled
  - 1f1) A scrambler applies scramble sequences to prepare solved puzzles for attempts. [NOTE: The word “solved” seems superfluous. I assume the point is to stress that a scramble sequence is applied to a solved puzzle, and not to an unsolved puzzle. So there are two points condensed into one point, namely, “scramble sequences must be applied to solved puzzles (not scrambled puzzles)” and “the scrambler applies the scramble sequence to the puzzle for attempts”. I think these points should be made separately, rather than condensing them into one sentence. ]
  - 1f2) Each competitor shall be available for scrambling, if needed by organisation team. Penalty: disqualification from the competition.
- 1g) Each event must have one or more score takers.
  - 1g1) A score taker is responsible for compiling results.
  - 1g2) Any change to the result on a score sheet must be made the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 1h) Competitors in the same round of an event may be divided into heats.
  - 1h1) Scramblers for a round must not scramble for competitors in their own heat before they have finished all of their attempts for the round. Scramblers and judges must not see or judge any scrambles from their heat that they have not attempted yet.
  - 1h2) Competitors in the same heat must use the same scramble sequences. Different heats must use different scramble sequences.
- 1j) All officials may compete in the competition.
- 1k) Officials may serve multiple roles (e.g. organisation team, WCA Delegate, judge, score taker, scrambler).


## Article 2: Competitors

- 2a) Any person may compete in a WCA competition if he:
  - 2a1) Complies with WCA Regulations.
  - 2a2) Meets the competition requirements, which must be clearly announced before the competition.

- 2e) Competitors must represent a country of which they hold citizenship. The WCA Delegate should verify citizenship standing by means of documents (e.g. a passport). If a competitor is found ineligible to represent the country under which they have registered, the competitor may be disqualified retroactively and/or suspended, at the discretion of the WCA Board.
  - 2e1) The eligible countries are defined by the Wikipedia article "List of sovereign states" ("UN member states and observer states" and "Other states").

- 2g) Competitors must remain quiet when inside the designated competition area. Talking is permitted, but must be kept at a reasonable level, and away from competitors who are actively competing.
- 2h) Competitors shall be fully dressed while in the competition venue. At the discretion of the Delegate, competitors may be disqualified from the competition for inappropriate clothing.
- 2i) While competing, competitors must not use sound or other electronic equipment (e.g. cell phones, MP3 players, dictaphones, additional lighting).
- 2j) The WCA Delegate may disqualify a competitor from a specific event.
  - 2j1) If a competitor is disqualified from an event for any reason, he is not eligible for any more attempts in the event.
  - 2j2) If a competitor is disqualified during the course of an event, his earlier results shall remain valid. Exception: cheating or defrauding (see Regulation 2k2a).
- 2k) The WCA Delegate may disqualify a competitor from the competition (i.e. from all events of the competition) if the competitor:
  - 2k1) Fails to check in or register in time for the competition.
  - 2k2) Is suspected of cheating or defrauding the officials during the competition.

  - 2k5) Fails to abide by WCA Regulations during the competition.
- 2l) A competitor may be disqualified immediately, or after a warning, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction. [NOTE: 2l-2p: I think this should be re-formatted, seeing as some parts follow directly from others. I think 2m should be 2l1. 2o should be 2n1 and 2p should be 2n2. And what if there isn’t a next round of the event? It should have something like “and before the beginning of the next round of the event, if applicable”. The same goes for 2p. What if there isn’t a next round? How long does the delegate have then?]
- 2m) A disqualified competitor is not eligible for the refund of any expenses due to participating in the competition.
- 2n) Competitors may verbally dispute a ruling to the WCA Delegate.
- 2o) Disputes are only permitted during the competition, within 30 minutes after the disputed incident happened and before the beginning of the next round of the event.
- 2p) The WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute before the beginning of the next round of the event.

  - 2s3) Competitors with other disabilities that may prevent them from abiding by one or more WCA Regulations may request special accommodations with the WCA Delegate.
- 2t) Each competitor must be familiar with and understand the WCA Regulations before the competition.


## Article 3: Puzzles

- 3a) Competitors must provide their own puzzles for the competition.
  - 3a1) Competitors must be present and ready to compete when they are called to compete for a round. Penalty: disqualification from the event.
- 3b) Puzzles must be fully operational, such that normal scrambling is possible.
- 3c) Polyhedral puzzles must use a colour scheme with one colour per face in the solved state. Each puzzle variation must have moves, states and solutions functionally identical to the original puzzle.
- 3d) Puzzles must have coloured stickers, coloured tiles, or painted/printed colours.
  - 3d1) Exception: Competitors with a medically documented visual disability may use textured puzzles with different textures on different faces. Textures/patterns must be uniform per face. Each face should have a distinct colours, to aid in scrambling and judging.
- 3e) The colours of puzzles must be solid, with one uniform colour per face. Each colour on the puzzle must be clearly distinct from the other colours.
- 3f) Stickers/tiles/textures/paint must not be thicker than 1.5 mm, or the generally available thickness for non-cube puzzles.
- 3g) Puzzles may be refined internally by sanding or lubricating. [NOTE: To be honest I think 3g is superfluous, or belongs in the guidelines. If it’s going to stay, 3g should come under 3h, i.e. 3h1.]
- 3h) Modifications that enhance the basic concept of a puzzle are not permitted.
- 3i) "Pillowed" and other modified versions of puzzles are permitted only if the modification does not make any additional information available to the competitor (e.g. identity of pieces), as compared to an unmodified version of the same puzzle. [NOTE: This is a bit messy. Currently it permits pillowed cubes then bans all of them in the same sentence, then allows pillowed 7x7s in 3i1. I suggest removing the start of 3i, i.e. “”Pillowed” and other”, and just start with “Modified versions of puzzles...”. If it needs to be made explicit that pillowed version of puzzles other than 7x7s are banned, make this point at the end of 3i, or integrate it into 3i1 somehow.]
  - 3i1) Exception: Pillowed 7x7x7 cubes are permitted.
  - 3i2) "Stickerless" cubes, and other cubes whose face colours are visible inside the cube, are not permitted.
- 3j) Any modifications to a puzzle that result in poor performance by a competitor are not grounds for additional attempts.
- 3k) Puzzles must be clean, and must not have any markings, elevated pieces, damage, or other differences that distinguish any piece from a similar piece.
- 3l) Puzzles must be approved by the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.
- 3m) Cube puzzles must have at most one logo. For the Rubik's Cube or bigger cube puzzles the logo must be placed on one of the centre pieces.
  - 3m1) Colourless engravings (max. 1 per colour) are not considered logos.
- 3n) All brands of puzzles and puzzle parts are permitted, as long as the puzzles comply with all WCA Regulations.


## Article 4: Scrambling

- 4a) A scrambler applies scramble sequences to the puzzles.
- 4b) Puzzles must be scrambled using computer-generated random scramble sequences.
  - 4b1) Generated scrambles must not be inspected before the competition, and must not be filtered or selected in any way by the WCA Delegate.
  - 4b2) Scramble sequences for a round must be available only to the WCA Delegate and the scramblers for the event, until the end of the round. 
- 4d) Scrambling orientation:
  - 4d1) Cube puzzles and Megaminx shall be scrambled with the white face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on top and the green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front.
  - 4d2) Pyraminx shall be scrambled with the yellow face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on bottom and the green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front.
  - 4d3) Square-1 shall be scrambled with the darker colour on front (out of the 2 possible scrambling orientations).
- 4f) Competition scramble sequences must be generated using the current official version of the official WCA scramble program (available via the WCA website).


## Article 5: Puzzle Defects

- 5a) Examples of puzzle defects include: popped pieces, broken wires, pieces twisted in place, and detached screws/caps/stickers.
- 5b) If a puzzle defect occurs during an attempt, the competitor may choose to repair the defect and continue the attempt, or to stop the attempt.
  - 5b1) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, he must repair only the defective pieces. Tools and/or pieces of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - 5b2) Any repair to a puzzle must not give the competitor any advantage in solving the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - 5b3) Permitted repairs:
    - 5b3a) If any pieces have fallen out or moved out of place, the competitor may place them back.
    - 5b3b) If, after repairing the puzzle but before the end of the attempt, the competitor finds that the puzzle is unsolvable, he may disassemble and reassemble a maximum of 4 pieces to make the puzzle solvable. [NOTE: I don’t see the need for 5b3b to be so specific. It can be significantly shortened and eliminate the need for 5b3c by stating that the competitor can take the necessary means to repair their puzzle as long as it doesn’t advance the situation of their solve. This prevents people from popping out the entire last layer and fixing it all up, and a twisted corner could never advance the situation of their solve so it wouldn’t need to be specified.]
    - 5b3c) If the puzzle is unsolvable, and can be made solvable by rotating a single corner piece, the competitor may correct the corner piece by twisting it in place without disassembling the puzzle.
  - 5b4) During blindfolded events, a puzzle defect must be repaired during the attempt, and all repairs must be performed blindfolded. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - 5b5) If parts of the puzzle are still defective or not fully placed at the end of the attempt, the result shall be recorded as the worst state obtainable by reassembling the puzzle.
- 5c) If a competitor has a puzzle defect, this does not give him the right to an extra attempt.


## Article 7: Environment

- 7a) A competition may be held at any location, indoors or outdoors.
- 7b) Spectators must remain at least 1.5 metres away from the competition stage when it is in use.
- 7c) Lighting of the competition area must be given special attention. Lighting should be neutral, such that competitors can easily differentiate among the colours on the puzzles.
- 7e) The competition area must be smoke-free, and must have a reasonable noise-level.
- 7f) Solving station:

    - 7f1b) Mat: The mat of the Stackmat.
    - 7f1c) Timer: The timer of the Stackmat.
    - 7f1d) Surface: The flat surface on which the Stackmat has been placed. The mat is considered a part of the surface. The timer is not considered a part of the surface.
  - 7f2) The timer must be attached to the mat and placed directly on the table, desk or other suitable console, with the timer on the side of the mat nearest to the competitor. The mat must be placed flush against the surface of the table.
    - 7f2a) Exception: For Solving With Feet, the timer must be placed directly on the floor. The timer device may be placed on the side of the mat farthest from the competitor.
- 7h) The competition area must have a Competitors Area.
  - 7h1) The organisation team may require that a competitor who has been called to compete must remain within the Competitors Area until he has finished all of his attempts for the round.
  - 7h3) Competitors in the Competitors Area must not communicate with each other about the scrambled states of the puzzles of the round in progress. Penalty: disqualification of the competitor from the event, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.

  - 9e1) The decision to add or remove an event is made by the WCA Board, based on feedback from the WCA Delegates and the community at large.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
  - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes are measured and rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second. 
  - 9f2) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
  - 9f4) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.
  - 9f5) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.
  - 9f6) For "Best of X" rounds, each competitors is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
  - 9f7) For "Best of X" rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.
  - 9f8) For "Average of 5" rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts shall be removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
  - 9f9) For "Average of 5" rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor receives more than one DNF and/or DNS in the round, his average score for the round is DNF.
  - 9f10) For "Mean of 3" rounds competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts shall count for the competitor's ranking in the round.
  - 9f11) For "Mean of 3" rounds, if the competitor scores at least one DNF or DNS, his average score for the round is DNF.
  - 9f12) For "Best of X" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following shall be used to compare results:
    - 9f12a) For timed results, "better" is defined as the shorter time.
    - 9f12b) For Fewest Moves Solving, "better" is defined as the shorter solution length.
    - 9f12c) For Multiple Blindfolded Solving, rankings are assessed based on number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings shall be assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings shall be assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles is better.
  - 9f13) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is the shorter recorded time.
  - 9f14) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds where two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor, where "better" is defined as the shorter time.
  - 9f15) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive and identical ranking for the round.
- 9g) A Combined Round consists of two phases of attempts, where competitors advance to the second phase if they meet a designated cutoff during the first phase.

## Article A: Speed Solving

- A1) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedure.
  - A1a) The organisation team may enforce time limits for attempts and/or rounds.
    - A1a1) The default time limit per attempt is 10 minutes, though the organisation team may announce a higher/lower time limit.
    - A1a2) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes). The time elapsed in a DNF result counts towards the cumulative time limit.
    - A1a3) For each round, any time limits must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who shall carefully consider the fairness of the change.
    - A1a4) The competitor must end each attempt within the time limit. If a competitor reaches the time limit for an attempt/round, the judge shall stop the attempt immediately and record the result as DNF. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see Regulation H1b1).
    - A1a5) An attempt shall be considered to meet the time limit if and only if the original recorded time, before any time penalties are applied, is strictly less than the time limit. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see Regulation H1b1).
  - A1b) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
    - A1b1) Simultaneous use of a Stackmat is optional.
    - A1b2) If the Stackmat time is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise, the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.
  - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (e.g. know how to solve the puzzle). A competitor competing with expectation of a DNF result may be disqualified from the event, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- A2) Scrambling:
  - A2a) When called for a round, the competitor submits his puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler and waits in the Competitors Area until he is called to compete.
  - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in Article 4.
  - A2c) After the scrambler starts the scramble, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
  - A2c1) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the beginning of the attempt.
  - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge shall raise any concerns with the scrambler, who shall then conduct a detailed check.
  - A2e) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation and ensures that it is covered completely. The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation.
- A3) Inspection:
  - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the beginning of each attempt.
    - A3a1) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and beginning the solve.
  - A3b) Before the competitor starts the attempt, the judge shall reset the timer and, where applicable, the stopwatch.
    - A3b1) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, he asks "READY?". The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute of being called. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
    - A3b2) When the competitor confirms his readiness, the judge uncovers the puzzle. If the attempt requires a stopwatch, the judge starts it at the same time.
  - A3c) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
    - A3c1) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - A3c2) If the pieces of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as stays within the limits within the limits described in 10f.
    - A3c3) The competitor may reset the timer before he starts the solve.
  - A3d) At the end of the inspection, the competitor places the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation and position.
    - A3d1) The puzzle must not rest on the timer. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A3d2) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "8 SECONDS".
    - A3d3) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "GO", and the competitor shall start the solve.
- A4) Starting the solve:
  - A4b) The competitor places his hands on the elevated sensor unit of the timer, with his fingers touching the sensors and palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the beginning of the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
  - A4d) The competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing his hands from the timer, thus starting the timer.
    - A4d1) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the beginning of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A4d2) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the beginning of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - A4e) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.
- A5) During the solve:
  - A5a) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
  - A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
- A6) Stopping the solve:
  - A6a) The competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.
    - A6a1) If a stopwatch is in use as the timing device, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that he has stopped the solve.
    - A6a2) When using a stopwatch without a Stackmat, the competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) in his hand and placing his hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the beginning of the solve.
  - A6b) The competitor is responsible for stopping the timer correctly.
    - A6b1) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt shall be replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits his right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.
    - A6b2) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt shall be disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, he may receive an extra attempt, at the WCA Delegate's discretion.
  - A6c) The competitor must stop the timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds). [NOTE: I think these regulations would make sense the other way around, i.e. A6d before A6c]
  - A6d) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
  - A6e) The competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.
  - A6f) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has recorded the result on the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
  - A6g) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. He must not make moves or align faces when examining the puzzle.
  - A6h) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
  - A6i) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.
- A7) Recording results:
  - A7a) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, he calls "OK".
  - A7b) The judge records the result on a score sheet.
    - A7b1) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded result displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format is "X + T + Y = F", where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer, Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result. If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).
  - A7c) The judge and competitor must both sign the score sheet to acknowledge the result.
    - A7c1) If the competitor or the judge refuses to sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate may sign in their place.
  - A7d) If the judge assigns a penalty, the judge shall call "PENALTY".
  - A7e) If the result is DNF, then judge shall call "DNF".
  - A7f) When a competitor's score sheet for a round is complete, the judge shall deliver the score sheet to the score taker.
